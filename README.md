# ancestral

DO (Disease ontology) is a formal ontology of human disease. The Disease Ontology project was developed to respond to the need for an ontology built specifically to cover the full spectrum of disease concepts annotated in biomedical repositories in an ontological framework extensible to meet community needs.

This program is designed to provide you with the names and DOIDs of your ancestors when you input the name or DOID of a disease. To use it, simply enter the disease name or DOID and the program will deliver the relevant information about your ancestors.
